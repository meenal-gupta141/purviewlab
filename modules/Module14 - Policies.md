# Module 14 - Policies

[< Previous Module](../modules/module00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module >](../modules/module00.md)

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

A new feature of Purview is Policies, which enables you to secure your data estate from within the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal. This feature is in Preview as of July 2022.

Data access policies can be enforced through Purview on data systems that have been registered for policy. This allows Data stewards and owners to grant read, write access to various data stores from within Purview by creating a data access plicy through the Policy Management app in the governance portal. This allows data owners to get a single view / modify of all access granted to all systems from a single dashboard.

A policy is a named collection of policy statements. When a policy is published to one or more data systems under Purview’s governance, it's then enforced by them. A policy definition includes a policy name, description, and a list of one or more policy statements.

## 1. Configure permissions for policy management actions

To make a data resource available for policy management, the Data Use Management (DUM) toggle needs to be enabled. A user, who will manage the policies in Purview, will need certain IAM privileges on the resource and MS Purview in order to enable the DUM toggle.

1. Grant IAM privileges to the user on the storage resource
    Navigate to the Access Control(IAM) page of the storage account resource. Click on "+ Add" --> Add role assignment. Grant either of the following IAM role combinations 
    * Owner
    * Both Contributor and USer Access Administrator

    

2. Grant Data Source Administrator role to the same user in MS Purview.
